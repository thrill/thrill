/*!
 * Signal helps you deal with the nasty callbacks in the land of callback-hell.
 *
 * Problems with condition variable the following:
 *
 * | consumer     |   producer
 * | |--req(&cv)--|---->req(cv)
 * |              |      |-do_stuff()
 * |              |      |-cv.notify_one()
 * | |cv.wait()   |
 * which can cause deadlocks.
 * A Signal is a one-time trigger. It can perform a state change exactly once
 * After that all consecuitve calls to 'Wait' return immediately.
 * Multiple threads can wait concurrently on a signal and will all be woke up
 * together.
 *
 * common::Future<T> offers the same functionality with the addition
 * of moving a data element between the threads.
