/*!
 * ThreadPool starts a fixed number p of std::threads which process Jobs that
 * are \ref Enqueue "enqueued" into a concurrent job queue. The jobs
 * themselves can enqueue more jobs that will be processed when a thread is
 * ready.
 *
 * The ThreadPool can either run until
 *
 * 1. all jobs are done AND all threads are idle, when called with
 * LoopUntilEmpty(), or
 *
 * 2. until Terminate() is called when run with LoopUntilTerminate().
 *
 * Jobs are plain std::function<void()> objects (actually: common::delegate),
 * hence the pool user must pass in ALL CONTEXT himself. The best method to pass
 * parameters to Jobs is to use lambda captures. Alternatively, old-school
 * objects implementing operator(), or std::binds can be used.
 *
 * The ThreadPool uses a condition variable to wait for new jobs and does not
 * remain busy waiting.
 *
 * Note that the threads in the pool start **before** the two loop functions are
 * called. In case of LoopUntilEmpty() the threads continue to be idle
 * afterwards, and can be reused, until the ThreadPool is destroyed.

\code
ThreadPool pool(4); // pool with 4 threads

int value = 0;
pool.Enqueue([&value]() {
  // increment value in another thread.
  ++value;
});

pool.LoopUntilEmpty();
\endcode

 * ## Synchronization Primitives
 *
 * Beyond threads from the ThreadPool, the framework contains two fast
 * synchronized queue containers:
 *
 * - \ref ConcurrentQueue
 * - \ref ConcurrentBoundedQueue.
 *
 * If the Intel Thread Building Blocks are available, then these use their
 * lock-free implementations, which are very fast, but do busy-waiting for
 * items. Otherwise, compatible replacements are used.
 *
 * The \ref ConcurrentQueue has no busy-waiting pop(), only a try_pop()
 * method. This should be preferred! The \ref ConcurrentBoundedQueue<T> has a
 * blocking pop(), but it probably does busy-waiting.
