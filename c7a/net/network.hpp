//! Technical details and notes:
//! The implementation of this class can be made either with a template
//! parameter or with inheritance, thereby specifying a topology abstract class
//! from which other class inherit and implement a certain
//! "CreateTopology()"-function. This has the benefit that the topology of the
//! network can be changed during run-time. When the implementation is done with
//! a template parameter, the topology can be specified only at compile-time.
//! This is also achieved with a function, which receives a user-defined
//! topology creation function and runs it.
//!
//! This can be also done by expecting a topology-creation function in a
//! member method. The member method then calls this function on the list of
//! groups in this class.
